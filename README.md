##Base Email Template

The template includes 1,2,3 column tables as well as left and right
sidebars.

Using this ‘fluid hybrid’ method you can build an HTML email with lots of different layouts that doesn't rely on media queries to look great on mobile devices.

Remember once you have finished creating your css styles, copy and past it in the header and use css inliner to inline the css.

#Note:

1. Design and code for mobile first as you can't change font sizes, dimensions or positions with media queries.
2. Background images aren't supported across all browsers.
